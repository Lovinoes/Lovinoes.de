### [`prplwtf`](https://github.com/prplwtf)*/*`www`
Unreadable website source code with more prettier errors than features.

<br>

**Selling points**
- Draggable window (whoa)
- Keys page with ssh public keys (what)
- Might work with GitHub pages (yay)
- Literally just a carrd website with a bunch of code slapped on top of it.

**Contributing**\
Trust me you do not want to try to work with this codebase.

<br>

**Installation**\
Figure this one out for yourself, it's literally just a static HTML website.
